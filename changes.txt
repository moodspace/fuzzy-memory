Changes between v0 and v1:
--------------------------------

NOTE: This visualization is redone so most things are changed.

Core:
 * The data remains the same. Figured out I can use the raw data as-is since file size is no longer an issue.

Visualization:
 * More dimensions as per parallel coordinates chart allows.. helps to compare the selected points. Old bar chart version can't drill down.

Interaction:
 * Can hover to peek / click to fix on a data point to reveal its detail.
 * Can search for games and add them to comparison.

Filtering:
 * Uses a combination of 5 filters. Old version had these so-called filters which were technically view toggles.

Others:
 * Localized libraries
 * More UI elements, instructions etc.
 * Multiple genre support.. it wasn't a feature.
